# year-3-X-ray-Spectroscopy
My university year 3 physics lab data and Jupyter notebook analysis.

All the excel data and Jupyter notebook stuffs. 

Some calculations, like angular dispersion and energy resolution are done manually with a calculator on my lab book, so no notebook available.

Some notebook will not run properly as I import excel file locally, not via an url. If you want to run them yourself, please modify them accordingly.

Feel free to use the code elsewhere, not useful nor eligant, takes more time writing comments than actual coding.

Please don't use the data unless you are my lab partners, I don't want to be kicked out of university due to plargarism. The experiments are conducted 
at low precision and in a rush, so don't trust them.

Presumably only lab instructors, my lab partners and me will ever access these things, but anyway, 
Please contact me if anything is missing or not working via 970875880@qq.com
